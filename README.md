## Introduction
In this project, we will go through the process of installing Jenkins and configuring it to create a Pipeline task. Since our task involves Docker, we will also use Ansible to copy necessary local files (such as Dockerfile) to a remote server. Jenkins allows for the automation of various software development, testing, and deployment tasks, while Pipeline enables the creation of complex continuous integration and delivery processes.

## Project Steps
- Install Jenkins: Install Jenkins on your chosen server using the official documentation.

- Configure Ansible: Install Ansible on the server where Jenkins will be installed, as well as on the server where Docker will be executed.

- Create Dockerfile: Create a Dockerfile for your project and save it in a repository.

- Configure Jenkins: Set up Jenkins to integrate with Git and Ansible.

- Create Pipeline Task: Create a new Pipeline project in Jenkins and define steps to perform the following actions:

-- Copy the Dockerfile using Ansible to the remote server.
-- Build and run the Docker container on the remote server.
- Testing and Debugging: Ensure that the Pipeline works correctly by executing test runs.

## Conclusion
In this project, we have successfully installed Jenkins, configured Ansible for configuration management, created a Dockerfile, and configured a Pipeline task to automate the creation and execution of a Docker container on a remote server. This process allows for efficient use of continuous integration and delivery for your project, providing quick deployment and convenient management.
